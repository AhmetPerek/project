Properties of Project

//BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM, PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE "appointments.txt" FILE AND PLACE IT IN THE FOLDER WHERE THE PROGRAM WILL RUN!!

//This project was written as a general appointment system without being specific.

//stdio.h and string.h libraries were used in the project.

//Customers can make appointments for full and half hours.

//Customers can make an appointment between 10.00 and 18.00. (10.00 included, 18.00 is not included.)

//Another customer cannot make an appointment for the appointment date and time made by one customer.

//Appointments cannot be made for years before 2023, for months with more than 12 entries, and for days with more than 31 entries.

//Each appointment is given an ID number, which is written on the screen after the new appointment is created.

//Appointment updates and appointment cancellations can be made later with the ID number.

//When an appointment is canceled, the ID number of subsequent appointments is reduced by one. (If there is no appointment after that, no action will be taken.)

//In case ID numbers are forgotten, all appointments and their IDs will be visible in the 'Taken Appointmens' tab.

//If TXT is not updated with tab 5 before exiting the program, appointments.txt will remain in its old state.

//If the program is not exited with the 0 tab, the program is in a continuous loop.

//appointments.txt contains two appointments by default. The program reads these two appointments when it first opens.
